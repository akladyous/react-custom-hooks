# React Custom Hooks

This repository contains a collection of custom hooks for React. Custom hooks are reusable pieces of logic that can be shared across multiple components. They
allow you to extract complex logic from components and reuse it in a modular and efficient way.

## What are Custom Hooks?

Custom hooks are functions that follow a specific naming convention: they start with the word "use". By using custom hooks, you can encapsulate logic that
involves state management, side effects, data fetching, and more. This helps in organizing your codebase and promoting code reuse.

## Why Use Custom Hooks?

Using custom hooks offers several benefits:

-   **Code Reusability**: Custom hooks allow you to share common logic between different components, reducing code duplication and making your codebase more
    maintainable.

-   **Abstraction and Encapsulation**: Custom hooks enable you to abstract complex logic into reusable functions, improving the readability and modularity of
    your components.

-   **Simplifying Components**: By moving the logic to custom hooks, your components become simpler and focused on their primary responsibilities, making them
    easier to understand and test.

-   **Separation of Concerns**: Custom hooks separate concerns by encapsulating logic related to specific functionality, such as handling form state,
    interacting with APIs, or managing local storage.

## Usage

To use a custom hook, follow these steps:

1. Import the custom hook from the desired package or create your own custom hook.

2. Use the custom hook in your component by calling it. The custom hook will return any necessary values or functions for your component.

3. Customize the hook by providing any required parameters specific to the hook's functionality.

Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useCustomHook } from 'custom-hooks-package';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useCustomHook();

  // Rest of your component logic

  return (
    // JSX for your component
  );
};
```
